      <h1>Learn The History</h1>
      <p>Learn The History is an exhibit that will be highlighting moments in history nationally and/or globally that is typically not taught in the classroom. Whether it’s creating content for national based history [ i.e.  Race Riots, Black Wall Street, …] or global based history [i.e. The Polynesian Panther Movement, Mansa Musa, Brixton Riot, …]. The exhibit would need pictures and/or video content to be displayed. More details would be provided through email.</p>
